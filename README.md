# 2024-1 Logistics Management Term Project: Superbin Circular Resource Transportation System and Route Optimization

## Overview
Resource Transportation System and Route Optimization project. This project aims to enhance the efficiency of resource transportation and optimize routing for the collection and distribution of recyclable materials using Nephron devices. This repository mainly handles data retrieval and CVRP(Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem).

## Vehicle Routing Problem
### Our Algorithm
We developed an algorithm that incorporates:
- Savings Algorithm with capacity constraints and fixed cost considerations.
- Additional time constraints and stochastic methods to enhance route optimization.

## Pipeline
1. creates Node, Link, Graph objects which each represent Nephron device, route, logistics network.
2. Updates all object status from pre-stored files acquired through NAVER map API.
3. Applies stochastic Clarke & Wright algorithm and visualizes ouput solution.
